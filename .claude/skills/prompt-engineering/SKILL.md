# Prompt Engineering

## Purpose

Systematically apply Anthropic's official prompt engineering best practices whenever writing, reviewing, or improving prompts. Run through a structured checklist of 9 techniques (ordered from most broadly effective to most specialized) to ensure every prompt is clear, well-structured, and optimized for Claude's architecture. Source: https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/overview

## When to Use

- Writing a new prompt from scratch for any task
- Improving or debugging an existing prompt that produces poor output
- Creating system prompts or role definitions
- Building reusable prompt templates with variables
- Reviewing a prompt before deploying it in production or a Claude Project
- Writing prompts for Claude Code CLAUDE.md files or custom instructions
- Helping someone learn how to prompt effectively

## Examples

**Example 1: Writing a new prompt**
```
User: "Write me a prompt that summarizes meeting notes into action items"
Claude: [Uses prompt-engineering skill] Applies the 9-technique checklist:
1. Clarity: Defines exactly what an "action item" is, who the audience is, what format to use
2. Examples: Includes 2-3 multishot examples of meeting notes → action items
3. CoT: Adds <thinking> step to identify decisions vs. tasks vs. FYIs
4. XML structure: Wraps input in <meeting_notes>, output in <action_items>
5. Role: Sets system prompt as "experienced executive assistant"
6. Validation: Adds self-check step to verify completeness
Delivers a production-ready prompt, not a casual first draft.
```

**Example 2: Improving a weak prompt**
```
User: "This prompt keeps giving me generic blog posts: 'Write a blog post about AI trends'"
Claude: [Uses prompt-engineering skill] Diagnoses issues using the checklist:
- Missing: context (audience, publication, tone, length)
- Missing: examples of good vs bad output
- Missing: negative constraints (what NOT to write)
- Missing: structured output format
Rewrites with all techniques applied, explains each change.
```

**Example 3: Building a prompt template**
```
User: "I need a reusable prompt for writing Jira tickets"
Claude: [Uses prompt-engineering skill] Creates template with:
- {{variables}} for dynamic content (feature name, user story, acceptance criteria)
- Fixed structure using XML tags for consistency
- Few-shot examples showing good ticket output with reasoning
- Validation loop to check completeness before final output
```

## The 9-Technique Checklist

Apply these in order from most to least broadly effective. Not every prompt needs all 9 — use judgment based on complexity.

For detailed explanations and examples of each technique, see techniques-guide.md.

### Technique 1: Be Clear and Direct

Think of Claude as a brilliant new employee with amnesia. Provide full context every time.

**Apply by asking:** What is the task? Who is the audience? What does good output look like? What constraints exist?

**Key rules:**
- Give contextual information (what the output will be used for, who will read it, what workflow it fits into)
- Be specific about what you want ("output only code, no explanation" vs. "write code")
- Use sequential steps when order matters
- Use negative constraints to prevent common failure modes ("Never use jargon. Never exceed 200 words.")
- Golden rule: If a colleague with no context would be confused by your prompt, so will Claude

### Technique 2: Use Examples (Multishot Prompting)

Examples are the single most effective way to get consistent, formatted output.

**Apply by asking:** Can I show Claude 2-5 examples of ideal input→output pairs?

**Key rules:**
- Include 3-5 diverse examples that cover edge cases
- Wrap examples in XML: `<examples><example><input>...</input><output>...</output></example></examples>`
- Include reasoning in examples (input → reasoning → output), not just input → output
- Make examples diverse — cover different scenarios, not just the happy path
- Anti-examples (showing what NOT to do) are powerful when paired with good examples

### Technique 3: Let Claude Think (Chain of Thought)

Give Claude space to reason before answering. This dramatically improves accuracy on complex tasks.

**Apply by asking:** Does this task require analysis, math, logic, or multi-step reasoning?

**Three levels (use the simplest that works):**
- Basic: Add "Think step-by-step" to the prompt
- Guided: Specify the exact steps to think through
- Structured: Use `<thinking>` and `<answer>` XML tags to separate reasoning from output

**Critical rule:** Claude must OUTPUT its thinking. Without outputting the thought process, no thinking occurs.

### Technique 4: Use XML Tags

XML tags are Claude's native structuring language. They prevent Claude from mixing up instructions, examples, and content.

**Apply by asking:** Does this prompt have multiple components (instructions, context, examples, input data)?

**Key rules:**
- Use tags like `<instructions>`, `<context>`, `<examples>`, `<input>`, `<output_format>`
- Be consistent — use the same tag names throughout and refer to them ("Using the document in `<source_material>` tags...")
- Nest tags for hierarchy: `<outer><inner></inner></outer>`
- Request XML in Claude's output too — makes it easy to parse programmatically
- Power move: Combine XML tags with multishot examples and CoT for maximum structure

### Technique 5: Give Claude a Role (System Prompts)

Role prompting turns Claude from a general assistant into a domain expert.

**Apply by asking:** Would a specific persona (analyst, editor, developer, advisor) produce better output?

**Key rules:**
- Set role in the system prompt, task instructions in the user turn
- Be specific: "You are a senior financial analyst at a Fortune 500 company" not "You are helpful"
- Role affects tone, depth, terminology, and focus
- Combine with constraints: "You are an editor. Rules: Preserve meaning. Improve clarity. Keep sentences under 18 words."

### Technique 6: Prefill Claude's Response (API Only)

Start Claude's response with specific text to control format and skip preamble.

**Apply by asking:** Do I need Claude to output in a specific format (JSON, XML) without preamble? (API/Claude Code only)

**Key rules:**
- Prefilling `{` forces JSON output with no intro text
- Prefilling `[ROLE_NAME]:` helps maintain character in conversations
- Not available with extended thinking mode
- A little prefilling goes a long way — even a few words can steer output dramatically

### Technique 7: Chain Complex Prompts

Break complex tasks into smaller sequential prompts where each step validates the previous one.

**Apply by asking:** Does this task have 3+ distinct steps that each need Claude's full attention?

**Key rules:**
- Each subtask should have a single, clear objective
- Use XML tags to pass outputs between prompts
- Consider self-correction chains: generate → validate → fix
- Use for: research synthesis, document analysis, iterative content creation, multi-step workflows

### Technique 8: Long Context Tips

When working with large documents (20K+ tokens), structure matters more.

**Apply by asking:** Am I providing long documents, multiple sources, or large datasets?

**Key rules:**
- Put long documents at the TOP of the prompt, query/instructions at the BOTTOM (improves quality up to 30%)
- Wrap documents in `<document>` tags with `<source>` and `<document_content>` subtags
- Ask Claude to quote relevant sections before answering (cuts through noise)
- Use `<documents>` with indexed `<document index="1">` for multiple sources

### Technique 9: Validation and Self-Checking

Add self-checking instructions to catch errors before final output.

**Apply by asking:** Is accuracy critical? Could Claude make errors that would be costly?

**Key rules:**
- Add to end of prompt: "After generating your answer: 1) Check it addresses all points, 2) Verify no contradictions, 3) Confirm format matches requirements, 4) Revise if any check fails"
- For factual tasks: "Quote the relevant source material before drawing conclusions"
- For code: "Trace through your code with a test case before presenting it"

## Prompt Assembly Order

When building a prompt, assemble components in this order:

1. **System prompt** (if using API): Role + constraints + rules
2. **Long context/documents** (if any): Placed at the top
3. **Task instructions**: Clear, specific, with negative constraints
4. **Output format**: XML structure or format specification
5. **Examples**: 2-5 multishot examples with reasoning
6. **Chain of thought**: Thinking instructions if task is complex
7. **Validation**: Self-check instructions at the end
8. **Query/input**: The actual content to process (at the very bottom)
